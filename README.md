# Projects 

## Deadline 23:59 5.12.2024

A project amounts to 20 points of your classwork grade (max is 50). 
A project is to be done by a single student, no teamwork allowed. 
The maximum number of points for a project is 100, with concrete subtasks having different values.
Each project should be followed by a written report in which the following topics are discussed:

* What the task was.
* The architecture of your solution.
* Why certain architecture decisions were done. 
* Why certain libraries were chosen.
* Investigation of the performance.

Choose your project [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138z6qgMBtROwDxh4niDajSIGZNb4r-ucpLowJDk7qjM/edit?usp=sharing). Max 3 students can take the same project, but they should work on it independently.
